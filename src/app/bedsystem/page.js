                    <div className='md:text-sm lg:text-lg xl:text-xl  xl:leading-10'>Travelers often encounter significant challenges when trying to find suitable accommodation during their
journeys. One of the primary difficulties is the scarcity of available options, especially in peak travel
seasons or popular tourist destinations. As a result, travelers may face limited choices or find them selves
settling for less desirable accommodations. Additionally, the high cost of lodging can be a major burden
on their travel budgets, eating into funds meant for other experiences or activities. The combination of
limited availability and soaring prices can lead to added stress and uncertainty, making it crucial for
travelers to plan ahead and explore alternative lodging options to mitigate these challenges.</div>

                    <div className='text-white text-xl mx-2'>The main advantage of the proposed vehicle bed system lies in the fact that the vehicle seats can be reclined all
the way backward, and the bed extends considerably from the steering wheel to the end of the trunk. Another

concept is applicable to both compact and large vehicles</div>
